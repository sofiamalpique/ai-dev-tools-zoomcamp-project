# AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp — Project

This repository contains my project submission(s) for the AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp course.

## Repository structure

- `first_attempt/`
  - Attempt 1 project submission (this is the one being developed).
  - It will contain everything needed to run the project: frontend, backend, MCP server, database setup, tests, and deployment instructions.
  - How to run Attempt 1 will be documented in `first_attempt/README.md`.

- `second_attempt/` (optional, not created yet)
  - If needed later, this folder will contain Attempt 2 as a separate submission.
  - The root README will be updated if/when this is added.

## Where to start

Go to `first_attempt/` and follow the instructions in `first_attempt/README.md`.
